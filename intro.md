Hi, my name is Pokey Rule, and I program my computer using my voice.
I started voice coding about two years ago. At that point, decades hunched over a keyboard had left me with repetitive strain injury, making it painful for me to use a keyboard.
It's no longer painful for me to use a keyboard, but I still code by voice.
My goal today is to show you that coding by voice...

- Should not be intimidating,
- Is fast,
- And, perhaps most importantly, it's fun.

To do that, we'll be doing a deep dive into Cursorless, a project I started two years ago to leverage the unique characteristics of voice as a medium for editing code.
